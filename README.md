[**Image info**](https://microbadger.com/images/dimaip/docker-neos-alpine)

Opinionated [Neos CMS](https://neos.io) docker image based on **Alpine** linux with **nginx** + **php-fpm 7.2** + **s6** process manager, packing everything needed for development and production usage of Neos in under 100mb.

The image does a few things:
1. Automatically install and provision a Neos website, based on environment vars documented below
2. Pack a few useful things like XDEBUG integration, git, beard etc.
3. ~~Be ready to be used in production and serve as a rolling deployment target with this Ansible script https://github.com/psmb/ansible-deploy~~ (I gave up on this deployment method, use 2.x version of this image if you need it, but rather consider full conatiner deployment)

Check out [this shell script](https://github.com/psmb/docker-neos-alpine/blob/master/root/etc/cont-init.d/10-init-neos) to see what exactly this image can do for you.

## Usage

This image supports following environment variable for automatically configuring Neos at container startup:

| Docker env variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|WWW_PORT|TCP port on which the container will serve incoming HTTP requests, defaults to `80`.|
|REPOSITORY_URL|Link to Neos website distribution|
|VERSION|Git repository branch, commit SHA or release tag, defaults to `master`|
|SITE_PACKAGE|Neos website package with exported website data to be imported, optional|
|ADMIN_PASSWORD|If set, would create a Neos `admin` user with such password, optional|
|~~BASE_URI~~|2.x image only. If set, set the `baseUri` option in Settings.yaml, optional|
|DONT_PUBLISH_PERSISTENT| Don't publish persistent assets on init. Needed e.g. for cloud resources.|
|AWS_BACKUP_ARN|Automatically import the database from `${AWS_RESOURCES_ARN}db.sql` on the first container launch. Requires `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ENDPOINT` (optional, for S3-compatible storage) to be set in order to work.|
|DB_AUTO_BACKUP|Automatically backup database at given interval, possible values: `15min`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`. If `AWS_BACKUP_ARN` configured, would also upload the file at `${AWS_RESOURCES_ARN}db.sql` location. |
|XDEBUG_CONFIG|Pass xdebug config string, e.g. `idekey=PHPSTORM remote_enable=1`. If no config provided the Xdebug extension will be disabled (safe for production), off by default|
|IMPORT_GITHUB_PUB_KEYS|Will pull authorized keys allowed to connect to this image from your Github account(s).|
|DB_DATABASE|Database name, defaults to `db`|
|DB_HOST|Database host, defaults to `db`|
|DB_PASS|Database password, defaults to `pass`|
|DB_USER|Database user, defaults to `admin`|


In addition to these settings, if you place database sql dump at `Data/Persistent/db.sql`, it would automatically be imported on the first container launch. See above for options to automatically download the data from AWS S3.
If `beard.json` file is present, your distribution will get [bearded](https://github.com/mneuhaus/Beard).

The container has the `crond` daemon running, put your scripts to `/etc/periodic` or `crontab -e`.

Example docker-compose.yml configuration:

```
web:
  image: dimaip/docker-neos-alpine:latest
  ports:
    - '8080:8080'
    - '1122:22'
  links:
    - db:db
  volumes:
    - /data
  environment:
    WWW_PORT: 8080
    REPOSITORY_URL: 'https://github.com/neos/neos-development-distribution'
    SITE_PACKAGE: 'Neos.Demo'
    VERSION: '3.3'
    ADMIN_PASSWORD: 'password'
    IMPORT_GITHUB_PUB_KEYS: 'your-github-user-name'
    AWS_RESOURCES_ARN: 's3://some-bucket/sites/demo/'
db:
  image: mariadb:latest
  expose:
    - 3306
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/data
  environment:
    MYSQL_DATABASE: 'db'
    MYSQL_USER: 'admin'
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: 'pass'
    MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD: 'yes'
```

## Utility scripts

Also this container provides a couple of utility scripts, they are located in the `/data` folder.

| Script name | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|backupDb.sh|Dumps database into `/data/www/Data/Persistent/db.sql` and uploads it to AWS S3, if it is set up.|
|syncDb.sh|Imports `/data/www/Data/Persistent/db.sql`, and dowloads it from AWS S3 beforehand, if it is set up.|
|syncCode.sh|For development purpose only! pulls latest code from git, does composer install and a few other things, see code.|
|syncAll.sh|Runs both syncDb and syncCode|

## Backups

Each container automatically takes care of daily backing up itself by running the `/data/backupDb.sh` script, which dumps DB and optionally uploads it to AWS S3. So if you store persistent resources on AWS S3, you are good to go (you should probably additionally backup the contents of S3 to some offline storage, but that's a different story).


## Two-step provisioning

You may build pre-provisioned images dedicated for your project from such Dockerfile:

```
FROM dimaip/docker-neos-alpine:latest
ENV PHP_TIMEZONE=Europe/Moscow
ENV REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/sfi-ru/ErmDistr
RUN /provision-neos.sh
```

It will already pre-install your project by running `composer install`, so the remaining startup will take about 10s, instead of minutes.
